        "**PART 1 INSTRUCTIONS:** You are an educational researcher interested in comparing different methods for teaching data science to undergraduate students. There are three different methods you are interested in comparing: (1) Direct Instruction (traditional method); (2) Inquiry-Based Learning (teacher facilitates student problem solving); (3) Collaborative Learning (students working in small groups). To compare these methods, you decide to randomly recruit undergraduate data science students to be part of a workshop on hypothesis testing basics. Students will be randomly assigned to one of three workshops, where each workshop employs a different teaching method. At the end of the workshop, students will be given a 50-question quiz where their understanding of hypothesis testing will be assessed. Percentage scores on this quiz serve as the outcome of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it would be apparent that the prior level of knowledge a student possess about hypothesis testing may serve as a potential confounding variable that you would want to control for. Thus, the Prior Knowledge a given student has about hypothesis testing is categorized into \"High\" and \"Low\". The data from this experiment are contained in the `Data Science Teaching Method.xlsx` file. With these data, your tasks are:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 1.** Briefly define the objective of this experiment\n",
        "\n",
        "-The objective of this experiment is how students' prior knowledge level (low vs. high) and the teaching method used can affect their outcome performace score.\n",
        "Also, the study can determine if the student approaches to different learning methods can have a differnt outcome for the students overall score.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 2.** Specify the outcome variable\n",
        "-Each student results (score) is the outcome varible and it is directly influnced by the teaching method and prior knowledge\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 3.** Specify the independent variable and blocking factor. What are some possible lurking variables?\n",
        "-The independent varible is the teaching method which come in 3 differnt categories (direct, inquiry and collaborative).\n",
        "Blocking varibles are the \"prior knowleadge\" (the low and high) because it is an pre-exsiting factor that could influence the students scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "The possible lurking varibles arestudent habits, instructor clarity, and test anxiety.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 4.** Briefly explain why a randomized block design would be appropriate here. Similarly, explain why a completely randomized design would not be appropriate.\n",
        "\n",
        "-A randomized block design is valid because the students prior knowledge affects the students score. By noticing the students prior knowledge, the experience can compare the different teaching methods. This can reduce its variability to improve on the results.\n",
        "For a completely randomized design would not work because the prior knowledge alter the outcomes of the students scores and unsure if the teaching method or prior knowledge would be unclear.\n",
